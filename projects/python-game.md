## Learning python
Learning python is something that I've been wanting to do for a very long time, I've had a little bit of experience with it, but never really delved too deep in it.
I'm planning on becoming a physicist, and in order to do that, I need to learn python. 
### Online Answers
So I looked online, I was looking for anyway I could hone my python skills, and then I saw these mini projects. I decided then and there that I would do one of them,
and that I would pack it full with as many extra things as I possibly could, which is how I came up with my version of the gtn game.

"""
Goals for guess the number (computer version):
1. Get user input to get the range of numbers.
2. get a random number in said range.
3. have the user guess a number within their own range.
4. compare the number they guessed with
   the number generated by the computer.

This code, which uses SQL to store its data, uses every extra aspect that I could think of to speed up my apprehension of the python language, and even gives me a good introductory to SQL,
which is undoubtedly something I need.
